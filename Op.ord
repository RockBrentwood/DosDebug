## This is the file "Op.ord".
## It gives the order preferences that must be respected by the assembler.
## Comments are as in the main instruction set file "Op.set."
## Each (non-comment) line should be a pair of keys.
## The table-generating program will check that the order of instruction variants
## for each instruction in the file "Op.set" is compatible with each pair.
## If not, it will scream.
